Dear Javier,

Here is the details,

Tuning range – 430MHz to 440MHz
Step increment – 10Hz
Modulation 
              GMSK, CW morse
Bandwidth
              GMSK = 20kHz
              CW = 500Hz
Power output 
GMSK = 800mW
CW = 100mW
Link budget = Same as old transceiver

Best Regards
Tharindu
